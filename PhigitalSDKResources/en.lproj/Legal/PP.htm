            <div class="privacy-secHeader">5.1 Gimbal:</div>
            Phigital's mobile applications are built using functionality referenced as Gimbal which collects, uses and stores the following information:
        </div>
        <div class="privacy-section">
            <div class="privacy-secHeader">5.1.1 Data Collection:</div>
            End-user Location fixes - latitude / longitude coordinates, accuracy estimate, time of day stamp and your location when/if your device is near any of Gimbal's public or private Bluetooth beacons – small devices that may be placed, for example, in retail stores or other locations – all of which are sourced from native OS location APIs. Location collection occurs periodically, based on significant location change events as reported by the native OS. Attributes of Wi-Fi networks visible by the device - BSSID and signal strength. Sourced from native OS Wi-Fi APIs.<br>
            Information about the end-user device (e.g., make, model, OS, and other similar information) but not phone number or UDID. Information about your version and use of the Gimbal software such as use of features, functions, or clicks on notifications or content. Information that end-users may enter in Phigital's application that is passed to Gimbal such as designating a private place (e.g., "my favorite store").
        </div>
        <div class="privacy-section">
            <div class="privacy-secHeader">5.1.2 Data Use:</div>
            Gimbal monitors end-user location to create place events ("at" or "left"). These events are used to notify Phigital's app when the end-user has arrived at or left places designated in experiences that the user has chosen to join, "POIs". Gimbal generates a list of the location clusters (identified by lat/longs) that the end-user visits frequently and may use these lists to infer the places you visit most often, determine your frequency at these locations, and notify Phigital's App when you arrive at or leave those places. Gimbal may also use the collected information to provide, protect, and improve Gimbal and our systems and services which may include sharing your information with agents, service providers, vendors, contractors, or affiliates who process the data only on our behalf for the purposes set forth above; protect our rights and the rights of our users; de-identify, aggregate or otherwise make the data we collect anonymous and use that information for our business purposes.

            Location fixes that do not generate place events are not stored. The single location fix that does generate a place event is stored on the client, along with the corresponding place event. The set of generated POIs are stored on the client. Place events and the location fix that caused the event are stored on the Gimbal servers. The set of generated POIs are stored on Gimbal servers. Gimbal Servers are located in the United States.
