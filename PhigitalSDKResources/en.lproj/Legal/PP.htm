            End-user Location fixes - latitude / longitude coordinates, accuracy estimate, time of day stamp and your location when/if your device is near any of Gimbal's public or private Bluetooth beacons â€“ small devices that may be placed, for example, in retail stores or other locations â€“ all of which are sourced from native OS location APIs.

            Information about the end-user device (e.g., make, model, OS, and other similar information) but not phone number or UDID. Information about your version and use of the Gimbal software such as use of features, functions, or clicks on notifications or content.

            <div class="privacy-secHeader">5.1.2 Data Use:</div>

These events are used to notify Phigital's app when the end-user has arrived at or left places designated in experiences that the user has chosen to join, "POIs". Gimbal generates a list of the location clusters (identified by lat/longs) that the end-user visits frequently and may use these lists to infer the places you visit most often, determine your frequency at these locations, and notify Phigital's App when you arrive at or leave those places. Gimbal may also use the collected information to provide, protect, and improve Gimbal and our systems and services which may include sharing your information with agents, service providers, vendors, contractors, or affiliates who process the data only on our behalf for the purposes set forth above; protect our rights and the rights of our users; de-identify, aggregate or otherwise make the data we collect anonymous and use that information for our business purposes.
