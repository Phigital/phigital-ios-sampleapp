        <div class="tos-section">
            <span class="tos-secHeader">4.1</span> Subject to the Terms, the Phigital Services is provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services will be determined by Phigital at its sole discretion and posted on its website (or such URL as Phigital may provide) from time to time.<br>
            <span class="tos-secHeader">4.2</span> For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in Phigital fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Phigital incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Phigital's measurements of your use of the Phigital Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Phigital and only in the form of credit for the Phigital Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates Phigital to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Phigital may be shared by Phigital with companies who work on Phigital's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Phigital and servicing your account. Phigital may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Phigital shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Phigital reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Phigital Services to you for any late payments.<br>
            <span class="tos-secHeader">4.3</span> Phigital may change its fees and payment policies for the Phigital Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website (or such other URL Phigital may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.<br>
            <span class="tos-secHeader">4.4</span> You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Phigital Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.
